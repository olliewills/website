      <p class="govuk-caption-m">May 2020 to present</p>
      <p>
        Joining Talend was a huge step for me as it meant leaving my home country behind in search of a new life abroad for my family. This role gave me the chance to develop a range of new technical skills and to support the growth of a design system that
        was just getting started. It would challenge me in a huge number of ways, many of which I knew I wouldn't see coming!

        It's an interesting time to be working in digital as part of the UK government. This role offered me the chance to work with a modern design system that's based on extensive user research. In addition, I'd be helping to shape the way businesses in
        the UK are run and my work would have tangible benefits for a huge user base.

      <p>
        My move to ACT was driven by the fact that the company was embarking on a programme of change. New technologies were being investigated, new services developed, new teams created and new offices opened. This would provide me with plenty of

        Multicom was an exciting prospect at the time I joined. It would be my first major experience of a software development environment. They were using Agile which was becoming hugely popular and they were just starting to build web interfaces for their

        I left university with good practical skills and the ability to
        <i>make</i>
        stuff. I'd always been interested in people and why they do the things they do, so research into human computer interfaces seemed like an ideal partnership to my practical skills.
